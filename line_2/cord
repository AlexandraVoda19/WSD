art} aphb 07800667: The davits creaked , the pulleys squealed , and the boats slowly swung out free of the ship . Next , a few feet of line were paid out , so that each boat would lie flush with the Boat Deck ... or , in some cases , flush with Promenade Deck A directly below .
art} aphb 07801528: Then he realized he needn't try any longer the boat was floating off . He jumped in ... cut the stern lines ... yelled for someone to free the bow ... and in the next instant was washed out by the same wave that swept off Peter Daly .

What he could not see was how the constant working of the cage was wearing the line thin where it was tied to the railing . A big sea , a heavy roll , and the line finally parted . With the next roll the cage slid a foot , then was stopped by the slackening line . On the following roll the cage slid back a foot and Ben's great weight behind it shot the cage forward and snapped the remaining lines .
art} aphb 08303361: The boat rolled again , and the cage slid away from the winch . The men ran with lines , shouting , trying to get the lines around the cage to snub it tight against the rail . Before they could tighten their lines , the cage jerked free , shot across the deck , and struck the winch a mighty timber-shattering blow that caved in one side of the cage .
art} aphb 08502144: All animal life was new and full of wonder for Jim as much as for Chet , and he longed to see a fish , to touch its scaly sides , to examine its gills . But when ten minutes had passed without a nibble on Chet's line , Jim started to give up hope .

" They gathered around all but Chet , who went on dangling his line stolidly as though the entire success of their journey depended on his luck as a fisherman .

They haul on the line to bring the boat in , but the power of the current , striking obliquely against her , shoots her out into the middle of the river .
art} aphb 08800568: They haul on the line to bring the boat in , but the power of the current , striking obliquely against her , shoots her out into the middle of the river .
